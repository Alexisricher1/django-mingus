A Django blog engine leveraging only existing reusable apps, and django-snippets. The project itself defines no models (db schemas).

More details to come soon, tutorials, etc. There are some hidden "features" (ex. api support for Django-springsteen out of the box meaning easy plugin to findjango.com, and some others stuff the community has provided.)

*This was an initial project for a Django-NYC presentation, thrown together with some concepts for a personal blog engine I've had in notes laying around..

Quickstart (VirtualENV/PIP Version)
------------------------------------

> mkvirtualenv myblog
> easy_install pip
> hg clone https://montylounge@bitbucket.org/montylounge/django-mingus/
#I do the next two steps below because I'm not familiar enough with HG to retrieve a subdir of a repository
> mv django-mingus/mingus .
> rm -rf django-mingus
> cd mingus
> pip install -r requirements
... wait a bit
> mv local_settings.py.template local_settings.py
> ./manage.py syncdb
> ./manage.py runserver

By default the theme is set to the Basic theme.

Django-Mingus also comes with 4 additional themes: Django(green), Minimal (black/white), Dark (black), Basic (beige/red), JeffCroft (brown/pink)

To switch "themes" just change this line in templates/base.html:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/themes/basic.css" type="text/css" media="all" charset="utf-8">

You'll notice the themes/basic.css text - change that to one of the existing themes, or edit away on your own!
